# **Briefly About Myself:**
After graduation, she was looking for herself in the field of 
logistics. 
I realized that this area is not for me and started looking for myself. 
Graduated from web design courses. 
The courses had the basics of layout. 
I liked it and wanted to delve into the development. 
It was difficult, but very interesting. 
I've had several interviews. 
They showed that there is not enough knowledge. 
I keep learning and learning new things. 
Now my goal is to master js and master the framework. 
Get a job at the frontend IT company as a frontend developer.
